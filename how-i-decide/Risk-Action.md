# Risk Action Tracker — With Escalation Logic

*This is a thinking exercise, not a real organisation.*

---

## Purpose

This tracker exists to ensure that identified risks are converted into completed actions.

It links directly to:
- AI Risk Register  
- Risk Acceptance decisions  
- Board and Risk Committee reporting  

> A risk that has been identified but not actioned is not managed — it is documented.

This tracker makes open risk actions visible, owned, and time-bound.

---

## Scope

This tracker captures:

- All remediation actions arising from risk register entries  
- Actions linked to risk acceptance conditions  
- Actions arising from incidents, audits, or regulatory reviews  

---

## Action Status Definitions

| Status | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Open | Action agreed but not yet started |
| In Progress | Action actively being worked |
| At Risk | Likely to miss deadline |
| Overdue | Deadline passed without completion |
| Completed | Action delivered and validated |
| Closed | Completed and no longer requires tracking |

---

## Escalation Rules

| Condition | Escalation |
|----------|-----------|
| Action at risk (within 7 days of deadline) | Notify risk owner |
| Action overdue (0–14 days) | Escalate to Head of GRC |
| Action overdue (>14 days) | Escalate to Executive (CRO / COO) |
| Action overdue (>30 days) | Report to Risk Committee / Board |

> Escalation is automatic. It is not dependent on the action owner choosing to report.

## Escalation Logic (How It Works)

Escalation is based on **time and visibility**, not severity alone.

- Risk severity determines **whether action is required**  
- Time determines **when leadership is involved**

Example:

- A high-risk issue with active progress → no escalation  
- A medium-risk issue overdue by 30 days → Board visibility  

This ensures:
- focus on execution, not just scoring  
- early visibility of delivery failure  
- consistent treatment across risk categories  

---

## Integration with Risk Governance

This tracker is reviewed:

- Weekly by the GRC function  
- Monthly at Executive Risk Review  
- Quarterly at Risk Committee  

Board reporting includes:

- Number of overdue actions  
- Actions overdue >30 days  
- Actions linked to high-risk items (residual ≥ 9)  

---

## Failure Mode This Prevents

This tracker exists to prevent a specific failure:

> Risks are identified, documented, and accepted — but the actions required to manage them are not completed.

This is the failure mode observed in the Databridge incident.

---

## Ownership

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|--------------|
| Action Owner | Deliver action by deadline |
| Head of GRC | Maintain tracker; enforce escalation |
| CRO / COO | Resolve escalated delays |
| Risk Committee | Oversight of persistent non-delivery |

---

## What This Tracker Is Not

This is not:
- a project management tool  
- a task list  
- a reporting form  

It is a governance control.

> If actions are not completed, risk is not being managed — regardless of how well it has been documented.
