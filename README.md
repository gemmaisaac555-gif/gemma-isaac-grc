# gemma-isaac-grc
Cybersecurity GRC portfolio covering risk acceptance, third-party risk, incident analysis, and regulatory compliance. UK-focused.
# Gemma Isaac — GRC Portfolio

**Cybersecurity GRC | Risk & Governance | Manchester, UK**

This portfolio demonstrates how I think about cyber risk, how I approach decisions under regulatory and business pressure, and how I communicate security to different audiences.

I am a career changer with an MSc in Computer Science and Cybersecurity (University of York, Merit) and a background in information governance, research methodology, and cross-cultural analysis. I am actively seeking GRC roles in the Manchester area and beyond.

> All artefacts use clearly defined fictional scenarios. They are thinking exercises designed to show judgement — not templates, not compliance theatre.
